:: Is tty ::

:Args: 
None


:Return:
Returns a bool, True or False.


:Desc: 
is_tty(), will check if the output medium is a terminal. The tty will not get validated however, meaning issues may arise due to incompatibility. 


:Usage:
```
reter.Terminal().is_tty()
```


:Example:
```
# Initialize terminal (Manually, quick_start() checks for valid tty automatically)
terminal = reter.Terminal()
cursor = reter.Cursor()
screen = reter.Screen(cursor)
line = reter.Line(cursor)
terminal.connect(screen, line, cursor)  # Connect TC objects to terminal

# Check for tty 
print(terminal.is_tty())
```
